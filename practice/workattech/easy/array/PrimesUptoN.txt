Primes upto N
Medium
50 / 50
Given a number, let’s say 10. Can you tell all the divisors of the number?

For 10, there are 4 divisors (1, 2, 5 & 10).
Let’s take 5, it has 2 divisors (1 & 5).

A Prime number is a number that has exactly two divisors → 1 and itself.
Note: 1 is not a prime number.

Divisors of Numbers:
2 → 1, 2
3 → 1, 3
5 → 1, 5
7 → 1, 7

Given a number, find all the prime numbers from 1 to that number.

Example
primesUptoN(20) → 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19

Testing
Input format
First-line contains ‘T’ denoting the number of independent test cases.

For each test case, a line containing an integer ‘n’.

Output format
For each test case, print a space separated list of all the prime numbers between 1 and ‘n’ in ascending order.
